```bash
cd project-01
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe
```
## [Project 02](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) 
```bash
cd project-02
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe

## [Project 04](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) 
```bash
cd project-04
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe
1. First the program loops from the smallest product of a 2 three digit multiplication to the largest
2. Then identifies whether or not the integer is a palindrome by converting the integers into a string and reversing the string
3. Then the program adds the palindrome's factors, that are thre digits long, into a hashtable
4. For each factor, the program checks whether or not there's another factor that would provide a product which is the palindrome number
5. When the program finds the two number, it is outputed
```
## [Project 05](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5) 
```bash
cd project-05
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe
1. The program iterates from 20 and onwards
2. This checks whether or not it is divisible by the numbers from 2 to 20
3. If one of the divisibilty fails, the while loop is exited and the number is incremented
```
## [Project 06](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6) 
```bash
cd project-06
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe
1. The summation formula is used to find the sum of the first 100 numbers and then the result is squared
2. The for loop goes from 1 to 100
3. Each number is squared and added to the variable sumOfSquare and the difference is outputed at the end of the loop
```
## [Project 07](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7) 
```bash
cd project-07
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe
1. The program loops through the natural set of numbers and looks for a prime number
2. Once a prime number is identified, the "count" variable is incremented and exists the loop once it's 1001
3. The program then outputs the number it's currently on which is the 1001'st prime number.
```
## [Project 08](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8) 
```bash
cd project-08
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe
1. The program multiples every consecutive 13 digits of the number and adds the product into a list.
2. Once that is done, the list is sorted into ascending order and the last element of the list is the largest product which is diplayed onto the screen.
```
## [Project 09](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9) 
```bash
cd project-09
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\Roslyn\csc" Program.cs
Program.exe
1. The program uses Euclid's method of finding Pythagorean Triplets.
