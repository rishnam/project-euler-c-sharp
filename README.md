1. First the program loops from the smallest product of a 2 three digit multiplication to the largest
2. Then identifies whether or not the integer is a palindrome by converting the integers into a string and reversing the string
3. Then the program adds the palindrome's factors, that are thre digits long, into a hashtable
4. For each factor, the program checks whether or not there's another factor that would provide a product which is the palindrome number
5. When the program finds the two number, it is outputed

1. The program iterates from 20 and onwards
2. This checks whether or not it is divisible by the numbers from 2 to 20
3. If one of the divisibilty fails, the while loop is exited and the number is incremented

1. The summation formula is used to find the sum of the first 100 numbers and then the result is squared
2. The for loop goes from 1 to 100
3. Each number is squared and added to the variable sumOfSquare and the difference is outputed at the end of the loop
